class GymEnvFromGameAndPlayer2(gym.Env, Generic[S, A]):
    """
    A Gymnasium environment adapter around a two-player game and a fixed opponent.

    One `step(action)` applies the *agent's* action first. If the state is not
    terminal, the opponent acts immediately. The returned observation reflects
    the state *after* the opponent move (or after the agent move if terminal).

    Parameters
    ----------
    game : GameProtocol[S, A]
        The underlying game.
    other_player : PlayerProtocol[S, A]
        The opponent that moves after the agent.
    encoder : EncoderProtocol[S, A]
        Provides `observation_space`, `action_space`, and (de)coders.
    max_steps : Optional[int]
        If provided, `truncated=True` when step count reaches this limit.
    rng : Optional[Generator]
        `numpy.random.Generator` used for sampling.  If *None*, the policy
        creates an independent generator via `default_rng()`.
    logger : Optional[logging.Logger]
        Logger for debug/errors.

    Returns (Gym API)
